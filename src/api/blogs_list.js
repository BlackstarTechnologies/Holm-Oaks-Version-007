          title: "THE MONTESSORI WAY OF EDUCATION",
          content: [
            "What is unique in the Montessori way of education is that it allows the children to approach the different academic subjects by manipulative materials. Montessori therefore offers children a hands-on learning experience. Many traditional programs teach children using two senses – seeing and hearing. For example, when the teacher is showing the children the letters of the alphabet, the teacher will show the children the shape of the alphabet letter (seeing) and tell them the sound of the letter (hearing). In Montessori, children are provided with an extra sensorial experience to their learning based on the evidence that children grasp concepts more easily when it appeals to as many of their senses as possible (sight, touch, taste, hearing and smell). Using the example mentioned above, a Montessori teacher uses Montessori sandpaper letters to give the children an extra tactile experience to their learning and this enables them to learn more easily.",
            "There is a lot of evidence from neuroscience that shows a strong connection between the brain and the hands. The hands give information to the brain, the brain receives the information and guides the hands in a continuous cycle that results in the development of the intellect. ",

          title: "MONTESSORI PHILOSOPHY",
          content:
            "The Montessori philosophy created by Dr. Maria Montessori centers on the education of a child as a complete and unique individual. This child, however, does not exist alone but is part of a community which is also part of the entire globe. For this child to be a productive and loving citizen of the world, he or she needs an education program that addresses his or her optimum development - intellectually, physically, emotionally and spiritually.  This philosophy is the basis for the Montessori method of education.",

          title: "MONTESSORI PREPARED ENVIRONMENT",
          content: [
            "The Montessori classroom is prepared to provide a warm and welcoming environment that makes the children feel safe and comfortable. The materials are laid out in an organized, uncluttered manner in open shelves. This is meant to encourage the children to participate in the diverse activities for purposes of self-development.  The classroom also has sufficient open space for the children to freely and independently move around.",
            "In order to keep the children’s focus on the materials, Montessori classroom walls feature minimal pictures and paintings.  The goal is that the walls should never look crowded, overstimulating with color or messy.",
